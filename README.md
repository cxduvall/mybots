Assignment 6 for the Northwestern course CS 396 -- Artificial Life. Running "python3 main.py" will show a sequence of randomly-generated snake-like artificial creatures, each with a random number of segments to their body (2-6), a 50% chance of each segment having a sensor (segments with sensors are green, ones without are blue) and random shapes for each segment (0.5-6 units long, 0.5-4 units wide or tall).
